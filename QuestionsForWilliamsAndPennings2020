Answer the following questions:

1.	What are the signals of hard selective sweep in the patient 013?
2.	What are the signals of soft selective sweep in Figure 5?
3.	What determines how likely soft and hard sweeps are?
4.	Based on figure 7, plot the allele frequencies of all alleles in nucleotide position 309 across time. You can make a plot by hand or by computer. Upload your answer as a pdf.
5.	Figure 8: what can cause hardening of soft sweeps?
6.	Figure 9: what can cause softening of hard sweeps?
7.	Figure 10: calculate at least two measures of linkage disequilibrium between nucleotide positions 138 and 226 on day 83.
8.	Figure 14. What happens to the frequency of K103N and what could have caused it?
9.	Figure 15. Plot Wattersons Î¸ (based on S) per bp across time. Note that the figure only displays variable sites. You can make a plot by hand or by computer. Upload your answer as a pdf.
